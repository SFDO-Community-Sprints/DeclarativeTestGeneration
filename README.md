### Project Vision (Your first task as a team)
Let people know what the value and intended benefits of your project are. The most successful projects will have an extremely clear and well-articulated vision. Answer these questions before you start talking about solutions:
Current test framework is handled by APEX code and is not easily applicable to declarative customization. A test framework for declarative automation, with a regression test function created using Flow, administrators could create new customizations without worrying about whether a validation rule or Process Builder automation was breaking other components of their organization.
This framework and test functionality would be most helpful for administrators and implementation partners adding declarative customizations to Salesforce organizations where code maintenance is not practical.

### Project Resources
* Indicate if there are any existing Hub Ideas, or product Issues/Bugs that you're solving for. 
* Where can we find additional information on your project? Ie. do you have supporting code in another Repo, do you have documentation in Google, your repo's Wiki, etc.? Be sure to include (or at least links to) all supporting material here. If it's not in your project Repo, it will get lost.

### Project Team Accomplishments
What did the Project Team accomplished during the Sprint?

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Often, it takes multiple Sprints to contribute an idea back into the Community. What happens at a Sprint does not stay at a Sprint! If someone were to contribute to this project at the next Sprint what would you want them to work on to move this project forward?<br><br>
* What is your project's Roadmap?

**Important**: If you have specific asks to help move this project forward we would recommend that you list them here, but also create separate Issues for each and add the label of "help wanted". This is a well-worn best practice for projects living in GitHub.
